## WinUI Gallery app

Get the *WinUI Gallery* apps from the Microsoft Store to see XAML controls and the [Fluent Design System](https://developer.microsoft.com/fluentui#/) in action. The **WinUI 3 Gallery** and **WinUI 2 Gallery** apps include interactive examples of most WinUI 3 and WinUI 2 controls, features, and functionality. The apps are an interactive companion to this website. When you have them installed, you can use links on individual control pages to launch the app and see the control in action.

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Get the [**WinUI 3 Gallery**](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9P3JFPWWDZRC) and the [**WinUI 2 Gallery**](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9MSVH128X2ZT) from the Microsoft Store.
> - Get the source code for both from [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/WinUI-Gallery) (use the *main* branch for WinUI 3 and the *winui2* branch for WinUI 2).

## Fonts

The Windows type system helps you create structure and hierarchy in your content in order to maximize legibility and readability in your UI (for more details, see [Segoe UI font family](/typography/font-list/segoe-ui)).

The following fonts are recommended:

- [Segoe UI Variable](https://aka.ms/SegoeUIVariable) (see [Typography in Windows](../signature-experiences/typography.md))
- [Segoe Fluent Icons](https://aka.ms/SegoeFluentIcons) (see [Segoe Fluent Icons font](../style/segoe-fluent-icons-font.md))
- [Segoe UI](https://aka.ms/segoeuifont)
- [Segoe MDL2](https://aka.ms/segoemdl2) (see [Segoe MDL2 Assets icons](../style/segoe-ui-symbol-font.md))

## Tools
